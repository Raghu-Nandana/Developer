    <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>

    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>
        <li>It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a nutshell, HTML is all about <b>organizing and displaying information</b> on a webpage. We can think of it as the <b>bones</b> or <b>structure</b> of a webpage.</p>

<li><a href="">&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;-</a>This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the document is an HTML5 document.</li> 
<li><a href="">&#60;html&#62;</a>This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
